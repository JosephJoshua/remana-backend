      The type of user that logged in:
        * `admin` - Store admin. The session ID is returned in a cookie named
          `session_id`. You need to include this cookie in subsequent requests.
        * `employee` - Store employee. The user needs to log in with a login
          code given by the store admin. The login code prompt ID is returned in
          a cookie named `login_code_prompt_id`. You need to visit [/auth/login-code](#/auth/loginCodePrompt)
          with the login code to log in.
